# Website Refactor

## Description
I updated the website with semantic tags to make the code more readable.
I added a descriptive alt tag for each individual image.
I updated the website title to describe what the website is about.
I updated the website headings to fall into sequential order.
I updated the CSS header divs to header nav.
I modified the class elements in HTML and CSS to consolidate them.
